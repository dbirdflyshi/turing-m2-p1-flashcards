# Turing Mod 2 Project 1 : FlashCards

## About 

### Functionality
This is a flash card quiz about array prototype methods performed completely in the command line. The user will be able to see questions, take guesses and see a final score at thends of the round. 

### Goals and Objectives
For the start of module 2, we will focus on test driven development. What this means is that we will be making the code based on the tests you first make.

These are the goals
* Contribute to a partially constructed object oriented application
* folllow prompts to make a working application
* implement ES6 classes
* Write modular code using SRP
* Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
