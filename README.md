# Turing Mod 2 Project 1 : FlashCards

## About 

### Functionality
This is a flash card quiz about array prototype methods performed completely in the command line. The user will be able to see questions, take guesses and see a final score at thends of the round. 

### Goals and Objectives
For the start of module 2, we will focus on test driven development. What this means is that we will be making the code based on the tests you first make.

These are the goals
* Contribute to a partially constructed object oriented application
* folllow prompts to make a working application
* implement ES6 classes
* Write modular code using SRP
* Implement a robust testing suite using TDD

## Where to Add Your Code

### JavaScript

**Create all of your feature code files in the `src` directory.**

We will be using the `module.exports` and `require` syntax to share code across files.

## How to View Your Code in Action

Once you are working through Iteration 3, you will want to start your server to test your functionality.
In the terminal, run:

```bash
node index.js
```

When the game is functioning appropriately, you will be prompted for each question, have the opportunity to select an answer, and will be given feedback. You will be able to play through the entire deck of cards:

## Test Files Organization

Similar to feature code, your test code needs to be put in a specific place for it to run successfully.

**Put all of your test files in the `test` directory.** As a convention, all test filenames should end with `-test.js`. For instance: `Round-test.js`.

## Running Your Tests

Run your test suite using the command:

```bash
npm test
```

The test results will output to the terminal.
